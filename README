Hi!

So just to provide some pin points.

1. Clone the repo
2. run ./run_me_first.sh
3. Wait a bit
4. Viola


NOTES:

- I dont know if you will actually run this, if so then it is recomended to use CentOS7 ( which I used ). It should owrk on any other Linux distro but you never know :)
- On last bash task I was not sure what exactly you need from the output ( sometimes process names do not match the root process therefore binary parth cannot be determined ) but I hope I got the righ thing. Maybe I totaly missed it but in that case I can correc tit jsut let me know what exatly you need
